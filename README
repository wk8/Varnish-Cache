This a slightly modified version of Varnish Cache, the high-performance HTTP accelerator.

I've added the ability for Varnish to replay the requests' bodies' contents when restarting a request in `pass` mode (see the description of the Varnish limitation I've addressed here at https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/ticket/652).

It is based off the 3.0.4 version of Varnish. You can easily review the changes I've made at https://github.com/wk8/Varnish-Cache/compare/9f83e8fdbd2a54047e4fa909758260db59a5e4b6...master?expand=1

To install: git clone, then cd to the repo directory, and run

./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install && sudo service varnish restart && echo "Done"

This custom version of Varnish is currently used in production. Questions and suggestions welcome at <wk8.github@gmail.com>.

Documentation and additional information about the vanilla Varnish is available on http://www.varnish-cache.org/
